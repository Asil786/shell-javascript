# Tutorial: shell-javascript

This project builds a simple shell (a command-line interface).
It works as a **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop), constantly *waiting for you to type commands*.
When you enter something, it **parses** your input to understand the command and its arguments,
then *decides* whether it's a built-in command (like `echo` or `cd`) or an external program to run.
If it's external, it *finds the program* on your system and **runs it**, showing you the output.
